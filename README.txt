# SeriousCreeper's Crafting Runes

Heavily inspired by Loot Roulette, this mod adds a common, uncommon, rare and legendary rune that can be used in recipes. 

It also contains an Unwritten Rune, which on use will turn into the other 4.
The amount and chance of getting each rune can be changed in the config file. 

It's only useful in combinations with Minetweaker or other mods that let you add custom recipes.
